# Crater_NAV
 Estimated the position of the Intuitive Machines Odysseus Lander based on an image that the company posted on the social media X. I did this by manually identifying craters in the image and the crater’s position on the moon. This information was used to solve the perspective-n-point problem using Grunert’s method.
